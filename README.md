-> CALCULATIONS:
FOR k-VALUE:
USN - ENG21AM3030
k VALUE = max{30, 0} = 30

For no of data points:
n = (30 + 0 ) *100 +1000 = 4000

-> INFERENCES ON THE MATRICES:
Here we can see that our KNN performs very well on all digits with few errors considering the size of the validation set .
However, it seems that our KNN has some little troubles with the 2 digits, they are misclassified as 1.
Sometimes it is very difficult to catch the difference between 1 and 2 or among any digits when curves are smooth.
